### How It Works

**Navigate the Site**:  
Users can access the text manipulation features on the homepage or explore the carousel component on the About page.  

**Manipulate Text**:  
On the homepage, users can input their text in the provided textarea and use various buttons to convert text, remove spaces, copy, or clear the text.  

**Switch Between Modes**:  
A toggle switch in the navbar allows users to switch between dark and light modes. The entire interface, including the text area and carousel, adapts to the selected theme.  

**Carousel Functionality**:  
The About page features a carousel component that highlights the key features of TextCrafter. The carouselâ€™s background, text color, and border change according to the selected mode.

**Real-Time Alerts**:  
Whenever a user performs an action (e.g., converting text, copying text), a real-time alert appears to confirm the action.
